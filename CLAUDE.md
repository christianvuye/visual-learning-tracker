## Session Overview
**Date:** July 7, 2025  
**Duration:** Extended development session  
**Objective:** Create a comprehensive Python GUI application for visual learners  

## Project Background

### Initial Request
The user requested that I create a Python project from scratch in a fresh directory, setting up git, virtual environment, and a complete application that could be finished within 20 minutes. I was given full creative freedom to choose the project type.

### Project Selection Process
I proposed 10 different Python GUI application ideas:
1. Personal Finance Manager
2. Digital Journal & Note Manager  
3. Password Manager & Security Vault
4. Habit Tracker & Goal Planner
5. File Organizer & Duplicate Finder
6. Personal Inventory Manager
7. Time Tracking & Productivity Analyzer
8. Recipe Manager & Meal Planner
9. Photo Gallery & Organizer
10. **Learning Progress Tracker** ⭐ (Selected)

The user chose the **Learning Progress Tracker** and specifically requested enhanced visual learning features including mind maps, knowledge graphs, and other visualizations for visual learners.

- Statistics cards with key learning metrics

### Phase 5: Testing and Integration
**Component Testing (`test_app.py`):**
- Database functionality verification
- Course and note management testing
- Mind map data structure validation
- Learning session tracking verification
- All core components tested successfully

**Integration:**
- Updated main.py to integrate all functional components
